        <h2>BOOKIE RULES & GUIDELINES</h2>
        <p>
            In order to create wagers and maintain wager creation privileges,
            bookies must follow the following rules and guidelines:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>NO NONSENSICAL WAGERS.</strong>
                <p>
                    Wagers must be clear and concise. No wagers that are
                    nonsensical or impossible to settle. No wagers where the
                    betting options are not clear or cannot be determined.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>NO BET MANIPULATION.</strong>
                <p>
                    Wagers must be honest and fair. No wagers that are intended
                    to manipulate the outcome or deceive bettors. No wagers may
                    direct bettors to vote in a certain way or to manipulate the
                    outcome.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>WAGER SETTLEMENT</strong>
                <p>
                    Wagers must be settled within 10 days of the end date. No
                    wagers may be left open indefinitely. Wagers must be settled
                    in a timely manner. If a wager is left abandoned it can be
                    claimed by another user as their own, and the original
                    creator will may be put on probation from creating wagers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>WAGER CREATION FEE</strong>
                <p>
                    Wagers must have a creation fee of 2 beans. This is to
                    ensure that bookies are invested in their wagers and are not
                    creating wagers for the sake of creating wagers.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
